# Agni Index - AI-Powered Digestive Health Monitoring App

A responsive web application for preventive digestive healthcare, built for a hackathon prototype.

## Features

- **Onboarding**: Welcome screen with app introduction
- **Profile Setup**: Collect user demographic and lifestyle information
- **Digestive Health Survey**: Interactive survey to assess digestive patterns
- **AI Analysis**: Simulated AI-powered pattern detection and analysis
- **Agni Index Score**: Personalized digestive health score (0-100) with categorization
- **Personalized Recommendations**: AI-generated recommendations based on user data
- **Daily Log**: Track daily digestive health metrics
- **AI Chat Assistant**: Intelligent chat interface with personalized responses

## Tech Stack

- **React** (with Vite)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Local State Management** (React Context API)
- No backend required (mock data and local storage)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd agni-index
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`)

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Design Philosophy

- **Healthcare-focused UI**: Clean, minimal design with white background and blue/green accents
- **No dark mode**: Consistent light theme throughout
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Accessible**: Clear section headings and intuitive navigation

## AI/ML Integration Notes

This is a prototype that simulates AI functionality. In a production version:

1. **Agni Score Calculation**: Would use a trained ML model analyzing historical user data
2. **Recommendations**: Would be generated by recommendation algorithms trained on large datasets
3. **Chat Assistant**: Would integrate with a language model API (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude)
4. **Pattern Detection**: Would use time-series analysis and predictive models
5. **Daily Log Analysis**: Would train models on user logs for trend prediction

Look for `TODO:` comments in the code to see where real AI/ML models would be integrated.

## Notes

- All data is stored in local state (not persisted)
- No authentication required for this prototype
- Medical disclaimers included where appropriate
- This is a hackathon prototype, not a medical device
